I'm Maxime Lenormand, although I mostly go by Max. It's simpler for everyone like that.

### Some things I do

- 🌲 I'm a geospatial data scientist at [Overstory](https://www.overstory.com). I work as part of team focused on mapping the height of trees from satellites images
- 🎙️ Twice a month I talk to people building the modern maps we use everyday on the [Minds Behind Maps](http://mindsbehindmaps.com) podcast
- 🖋️ [I occasionally write about stuff I've found and what's on my mind](https://mindsbehindsmaps_newsletter.ck.page/profile)
- 🌏 [I make videos about satellite images & maps](https://www.youtube.com/@MaxLenormand). These started as a way to explain what I do to my dad

You can find me online at most of the above links, or:

- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@MaxLenormand)
- There's a [contact form](https://www.mindsbehindmaps.com/contact) on the Minds Behind Maps podcast website

If you get value out of the stuff I do please consider supporting my work on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mindsbehindmaps). I also post behind the scenes of most of the projects I work on there.
