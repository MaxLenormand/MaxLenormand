### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maxime Lenormand, although I mostly go by Max. It's simpler for everyone like that.

Here are a few things I do:
- I'm a geospatial data scientist at [Overstory](https://www.overstory.com)
- I run the [Minds Behind Maps](http://mindsbehindmaps.com) podcast
- [I occasionally write about stuff I've found and what's on my mind](https://mindsbehindsmaps_newsletter.ck.page/profile)
- [I make videos about satellite images & maps](https://www.youtube.com/@MaxLenormand)

You can find me online at most of the above links, or:
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaxLenormand)
- [Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@MaxLenormand)

If you get value out of the stuff I do please consider supporting my work on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mindsbehindmaps). I also post behind the scenes of most of the projects I work on there.
